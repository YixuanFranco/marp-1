The first version of [Marp](https://yhatt.github.io/marp/) was released at almost 3 years ago. At first, it was started from a tool for personal usage. Unlike now it was called as _"mdSlide"_. Marp is amassed over [7,300 stars](https://github.com/yhatt/marp/stargazers) until now.

Today, I'm so excited to introduce the story of Marp Next! The current Marp was the presentation writer based on the familiar Markdown. But now is not only just a writer! We built a ecosystem to be used in widely.
